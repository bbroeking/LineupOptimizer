    "As fantasy sports grew in popularity over the course of the 2000's, players became dissatisfied in the season long format. Injuries to key players on a team could take your team out of contention early in the season. Players demanded a more flexible fantasy format and daily fantasy sports were born. Draftkings is one of the major providers of daily fantasy sports in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyday, Draftkings runs online competitions where between 2 to 50,000+ people compete to build the best fantasy baseball lineup for that day. The best lineups are formed by rostering players who perform well in live Major League Baseball games during that day and in turn score points for the lineup."

    "Stacking lineups has been proven to be the most effective and efficient way to make your Draftkings lineups better. [(Psychology of Stacking)](https://rotogrinders.com/articles/mlb-dfs-psychology-of-stacking-731014) In general, this is because each team has 27 outs per game on the offensive side. The less outs a player makes, the more chances other teammates are given over the course of the game. As a product of the additional at-bats, we are granted more opportunities to generate points. \n",

    "### No Duplicate Lineups or Lineups With Too Much Overlap (Constraint 5) \n",
    "To achieve success in these Draftkings GPP tournaments, you usually want to have a core of players in most of your lineups. This core gives you a good chance to place highly in the tournament when paired with additional well projected supportive players. This constraint is in place to force our lineups to be individual and overlap no more than 7 players from one lineup to the next."

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "One of the most exciting improvements we can make is developing an additional model to improve the selection of teams to stack. Currently, we are simply using basic Vegas lines, previous information and personal preference to select the teams that will be stacked. There are several datasets we could explore to improve our selection process.\n",
    "### Draftkings Contest Past Tournament Dataset\n",
    "After each Draftkings competition is completed, players have the opportunity to download data about the lineups played that night by each competitor with their place and scoring in the competition included. There are two potentially interesting options we can explore with this dataset. First, we can pair this data with other data to backtest our model and determine if our process is successfully generating potentially profitable lineups. Second, there is a small minority of players that take home the majority of Draftkings winnings. We can use the contest data to determine the successful players and explore their lineups to discover their strategies. \n",
    "### Donbest.com Dataset\n",
    "Donbest.com collects the moneyline odds and over/under totals for each MLB game played from various online sportsbooks. With this data, we can explore the correlations between moneylines, totals and placing highly in tournaments. Most Draftkings players will look at totals and moneylines to form opinions about the slate of games that night. Games with higher totals tend to create scenarios where those players are over-valued and over-owned. From here we can explore the tradeoffs between Vegas totals, player ownership and placing highly in Draftkings contests.\n",
    "### Statcast Dataset\n",
    "In partnership with Amazon Web Services, every Major League Baseball stadium has been equipped with radar technology that tracks every play. These tools collect data such as exit velocity off the bat and the spin rate of a pitchers fastball. Statistics like these have been revolutionizing the way baseball is played and discovering the predictive value of some of these statistics and incorporating into a model seem like the next logical way to get an advantage over the Draftkings competition."
